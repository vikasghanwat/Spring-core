ANNOTATION APPROACH

in this project we perform all bean related operation using annotation

1.creation of bean
2.scope of bean
3.custom bean
4.init()
5.destroy()
6.BeanPostProcessor
7.lazy & eagar

all these operations using annotation check project in deep

NOTE: if scope is prototype then destroy() method not work we have explicitly call bean which we want to destroy
